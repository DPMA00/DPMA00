## Hi there, I'm Dieter! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Electromechanical Engineer, graduated in september 2024. After taking some months off in China, I decided to fully dive into my passion for robotics, and control of dynamic systems.

I'm especially interested in intelligent robotics and autonomous vehicles, and I love working on projects that combine a proper amount of theory with real-world applications.

Currently I have a couple projects that are ongoing to deepen my knowledge in ROS2, C++, OOP, optimal control, numerical optimization, sensors, state estimation,...

Have a look at some of the projects I've worked on!
