## Hi there, I'm Dieter! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate Electromechanical Engineer with a passion for control systems, intelligent robotics, and autonomous vehicles. I specialize in Model Predictive Control (MPC), nonlinear optimization, and robotics, and I love tackling challenging problems that combine theory and practice.

ðŸš€ Projects:

Here are some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on:

1. Autonomous Parallel Parking using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)

2. Dynamic Obstacle avoidance using NMPC and linear Kalman Filter
